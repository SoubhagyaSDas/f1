      <em>For some it's super complex machines designed to go fastest round a circuit,
        for some it is nothing more than a regular motorsport, just with some big brands
        and sponsers, but to really know <strong>F1</strong> you have to visualise yourself strapped to
        your toilet seat going faster than you could blink and braking at speeds fighter pilots
        lose their consiousness.

    Before commenting on Formula One as a sport, lets talk about every sport of common interest, not that you don't know
    what football or soccer is but just for the sake of reference, lets think like what the game of football actually is!
    Thinking from your perspective, isn't it 22 players trying desperately to kick a ball into two designated nets?
    Isn't Boxing a lame concept of two guys never known to each other, trying their best to knock each other out as hard as possible?
    A game viewed with the purest of intent can never fail to interest you and just like that game, F1 for millions is the purest form of engineering
    syncronisation and hardwork.
